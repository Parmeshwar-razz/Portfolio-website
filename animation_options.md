# Professional 3D Animation Options

You requested a simple, elegant full-page animation. Here are 4 high-performance options that look great on portfolios:

### 1. **"Deep Space" Star Field** (Current)
- **Visual**: Thousands of tiny stars slowly rotating.
- **Vibe**: Infinite, clean, tech-focused.
- **Why**: Very low distraction, high performance.

### 2. **"Neural Network" Connections**
- **Visual**: Points connected by thin lines that slowly float and morph. Lines appear/disappear based on distance.
- **Vibe**: Data science, AI, complexity, patterns.
- **Best For**: Highlighting your data/ML background.

### 3. **"Digital Rain" / Sparkles**
- **Visual**: Particles floating gently upwards or falling like snow/matrix (but subtler).
- **Vibe**: Magic, code, fluid.
- **Style**: Can be neon cyan to match your theme.

### 4. **"Cyber Landscape" Grid**
- **Visual**: A wireframe terrain grid moving beneath the user, retro-futuristic style (vaporwave/tron).
- **Vibe**: Retro-tech, gaming, structure.
- **Note**: Might be slightly more distracting than the others.
